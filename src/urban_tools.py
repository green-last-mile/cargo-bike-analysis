##Â MAPPING TO CATEGORIES GENERATED USING ChatGPT4, using the following prompt:

# for all these tags, generate a number of high level descriptors that describe the function or type of urban make up to describe h3 hexagons using their associated osm tags.
# This will be used to then do analyses to compare and give an intuition behind the different urban regions.
# In a second step, we used chatGPT4 to generate regex rules to map the OSM tags to the generated high-level categories.

# Leisure and Recreation:
#     Sports facilities (sports centers, stadiums, tennis courts, etc.)
#     Public spaces (parks, gardens, playgrounds, etc.)
#     Tourism (viewpoints, artwork, museums, attractions, etc.)

# Barriers and Boundaries:
#     Walls, fences, gates, kerbs, etc.
#     Administrative, political, postal boundaries

# Utilities and Services:
